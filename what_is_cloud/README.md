# What is Cloud
When we talk about the cloud, we are usually looking at it in the context of allowing access to cloud computing. 

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services - such as servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and moreâ€”over the internet (cloud).

Instead of owning the hardware and infrastructure required for computing applications, companies can rent access from applications to storage from a cloud service provider. 
This is a marked difference to how infrastructure and hardware was historically managed - companies would have to have their own servers and databases on-site.

## Cloud deployment models
The four deployment models associated with cloud computing are as follows:

1) **Public cloud** - As the name suggests, this model supports all users who want to make use of a shared computing resource, be it hardware or software on a subscription basis. Common uses of public clouds are for application development and testing.
2) **Private cloud** - A private cloud is typically infrastructure used by a single organization. Such infrastructure may be managed by the organization itself to support different groups, or it could be managed by a service provider. Private clouds are more expensive than public clouds due to the expenditure involved in acquiring and maintaining them. However, private clouds are better able to address the security and privacy concerns of organizations today.
3) **Hybrid cloud** - In a hybrid cloud, an organization makes use of interconnected infrastructure, be it private and public cloud, or a mix or cloud and on-premises hardware.
4) **Multi-Cloud** - When an organisation use several cloud service providers for their IT needs. This could be for redundancy, or to leverage services only available on different cloud services.

## Types of cloud services
Notable examples of cloud services are:
- **IaaS** - Infrastructure as a Service. A service that offers compute, storage and networking resources.
- **PaaS** - Platform as a Service. A service offering a complete development and deployment environment in the cloud. Everything comes bundled in.
- **Saas** - Software as a Service. A service that offers software on a subscription basis. The softwares code is hosted centerally in the cloud.

## Why use cloud services?
Organizations use cloud services for a variety of reasons:
1) **Scalability**: Cloud services offer the ability to scale computing resources dynamically based on demand. 
2) **Cost**: By offering a pay-as-you-go model, organisations that keep on top of their cloud resources only pay for what they use. There is no upfront capital expenditure.
3) **Reliability**: Using cloud services provides robust infrastructure with built-in redundancy and failover mechanisms, improving resilience. This can be incredibly helpful for critical applications.

On the other hand, cloud services do come with some disadvantages:
1) **Security and privacy concerns** -  Although cloud providers invest heavily in security measures, there is still a risk of data breaches, insider threats, and compliance issues.
2) **Potential for vendor lock-in** -  Moving data and applications to the cloud can create vendor lock-in, making it difficult to switch providers or migrate back to on-premises solutions. This can limit organizational flexibility and increase costs in the long term, and leave an organisation vulnerable to price fluctuations.  
3) **Compliance and regulatory requirements** - Organizations should carefully assess the regulatory landscape, as well as client requirements, and ensure that their cloud provider can meet their compliance needs.
4) **Data sovereignty concerns**: Storing data in the cloud may raise concerns about data sovereignty, particularly if data is stored in data centers located in foreign countries. 

## Who are the major cloud service providers?

### Amazon (AWS)
 AWS is a comprehensive and widely adopted cloud computing platform offered by Amazon. It provides a vast array of services, including computing power, storage, databases, machine learning, analytics, and more. AWS is known for its scalability, reliability, and extensive global infrastructure, with data centers located in regions around the world.
### Microsoft (Azure)
Azure is a cloud computing platform provided by Microsoft, offering a wide range of services for building, deploying, and managing applications and services through Microsoft's global network of data centers. Azure provides services such as virtual machines, databases, AI, IoT, and developer tools, and it is particularly popular among enterprises due to its seamless integration with Microsoft's other products and services.
### Google (GCP)
 GCP provides services such as computing, storage, databases, machine learning, and data analytics, leveraging Google's global network infrastructure and expertise in data management and analysis. GCP is known for its innovative technologies and strong offerings in areas such as AI and machine learning.

## Operating Expenses (OpEx) and Capital Expenses (CapEx) in the cloud
Operating Expenses (OpEx) and Capital Expenses (CapEx) are ways of quantifying expenditures that a business incurs. They are treated differently for accounting and taxation purposes.

The distinction between OpEx and CapEx becomes particularly relevant in the context of cloud services.

### Operating Expenses (OpEx)
OpEx is  the day-to-day expenses incurred by business as usual (BaU) operations there to generate revenue. These expenses are deducted from revenue in the same accounting period in which they are incurred.

Examples of OpEx include rent, utilities, salaries and ongoing maitenence costs.

OpEx is particularly relevant to cloud services as these are typically billed on a pay-as-you-go basis. Typically billing for cloud services mean businesses pay only for the resources they use. These subscription fees, as well as associated costs for things like data transer, are considered operating expenses.
 
### Capital Expenses (CapEx)

CapEx refers to expenses incurred for the purchase or improvement of long-term assets that will be used in the business for more than one accounting period. The cost for these assest can be **amortised** over the time period they are used by the business - expenditure can be realised over many years.

Examples of CapEx include purchasing machinery, equipment, buildings, vehicles, and software licenses.

Purchasing on-site computing hardware is considered CapEx. Additionally, any customization or development costs related to cloud-based software or platforms may also be considered CapEx.

Organisations may want to pay upfront for cloud services if they are seeking bespoke solutions or services. They may also seek such arrangement to secure pricing, or provision for the delivery of a client contract.
